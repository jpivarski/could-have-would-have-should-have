# Could have, would have, should have

## Correlation does not imply causality

So what does?

causality in physics: "I knocked over the glass, which caused it to fall on the floor"

post-quantum physicists look back at classical mechanics as a time when causality could be taken seriously

but deterministic, classical physics doesn't seem to admit any causality: would you say "7 + x = 9 causes x to be 2?"

the word "causality" pops up all over relativity, but relativity only puts limits on how far apart (in space and in time) causes and their effects can be from one another

quantum mechanics complicates causality (some would say "violates causality") because there are correlations between events farther apart than relativity allows

but this still doesn't get at causality as "making something happen that wouldn't have otherwise" or even "being responsible for something happening"

## Causality of time travel

science fiction plays with the idea of causality a lot; after all, fiction/plot is a chain of "why?" questions and answers and science-inspired plots provide fodder

but most sci-fi is a mess of contradictions

typically destructive paradoxes: because a thing happened (Marty McFly stopped his parents from getting together), that thing can't happen (Marty McFly couldn't have been born to go back and stop his parents from getting together)

there are also constructive paradoxes, but they're more rare (By his Bootstraps); though theoretically possible
