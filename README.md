# Could have, would have, should have

Correlation does not imply causality. So what does?

causality in physics: "I knocked over the glass, which caused it to fall on the floor"

post-quantum physicists look back at classical mechanics as a time when causality could be taken seriously

but deterministic, classical physics doesn't seem to admit any causality: would you say "7 + x = 9 causes x to be 2?"

the word "causality" pops up all over relativity, but relativity only puts limits on how far apart (in space and in time) causes and their effects can be from one another

quantum mechanics complicates causality (some would say "violates causality") because there are correlations between events farther apart than relativity allows

but this still doesn't get at causality as "making something happen that wouldn't have otherwise" or even "being responsible for something happening"

science fiction plays with the idea of causality a lot; after all, fiction/plot is a chain of "why?" questions and answers and science-inspired plots provide fodder

but most sci-fi is a mess of contradictions

typically destructive paradoxes: because a thing happened (Marty McFly stopped his parents from getting together), that thing can't happen (Marty McFly couldn't have been born to go back and stop his parents from getting together)

there are also constructive paradoxes (closed time loop), but they're more rare (Oedipus Rex, All You Zombies, The Arrival); though theoretically possible (all you need is a time machine)

generally imagine a forked timeline: normal time is a linear chain of causes and effects, but a time machine lets the user fork the past into the "original timeline" and the "altered timeline." they either both exist (Mirror, Mirror) or only the most recently created or the timeline the main character is in exists

if they both exist, does the protagonist really do anything when they "restore the original timeline"? or are they just travelling back to a world they prefer?

Everett's many worlds hypothesis: maybe the multi-valued properties of quantum particles (e.g. a particle that's in two places at once) is really multiple deterministic worlds that communicate at small scales. sci-fi invokes this as an explanation of the forked timeline, but for its originally intended use as an explanation of quantum mechanics, EVERY minor variation in trajectory a microscopic particle could make spawns a new universe; the timeline is thick with forks

if every possible plot of a story is equally real—heros with 1000-to-1 odds actually lose 999 times—why should I care about the story in which they win? it's selective reporting

there's another extreme intended to save determinism in an apparently quantum world: superdeterminism. suppose that the universe is like a digital movie, consisting of pixel values at every grid point of the screen and time through the movie. there's no rule that forces a pixel value at one time to imply another pixel value at another time: everybody could glitch blue tomorrow. in this view, the long-distance, short-time quantum correlations that violate relativity's limits are accidental; Alice and Bob observe correlations no matter whether they measure X or Y because they can't choose to measure X or Y. They're part of the universal correlation that they're measuring

(maybe I have to explain Bell's inequality)

I don't believe either of these extremes, but they do highlight what's important in a theory of causality: (1) there has to be a distinction between what does happen and what could happen, and (2) experimenters have to be free to choose what experiments to perform. free will is a prerequisite for identifying causes, and therefore a prerequisite for doing science

what's a real world? idealism vs realism was a central preoccupation of western philosophy

logical/mathematical validity seems to be foundational because it can be perceived directly (a priori) and without error (CAN be, anyway); the discovery and redicovery of pi to hundreds of digits in classical Greece and China is a good demonstration that there's something real there, something both cultures had access to without being able to communicate with one another

empirical fact seems to be foundational because the minds that think up mathematical ideas are clearly machines; they can be dissected and observed in vivo with fMRI

the methods for deciding whether a mathematical statement is valid and whether an empirical fact is true have few similarities. they both require consistency, but mathematical statements must be proven via a grammatical machine while empirical facts must be proven by reproducibility and lateral measurements. the whole tool-set is different for these two things: why do we use the same word, "real" to describe them both?

Plato, etc. argued that math is real at the expense of the physical world; Democritus etc. argued that the physical world is real at the expense of human perceptions

why not say they're two KINDS of reality? "real" is a human word, we use human words to collectively label similar things that we encounter, and these two things (math and physics) are rather different, so let's use two words. I like "valid" and "factual"

furthermore, the way we think about science tends to treat these as two poles. in many fields of science, practiciners talk about "models." a model is a mathematical structure that represents an aspect of the physical world, but shouldn't be confused with it. maybe it's a rough model of stock prices, arbitrarily tuned to agree with the data, or it's the very precise Standard Model of particle physics, designed to truly answer the question of "what's really going on?" but still physicists don't BELIEVE in it. they expect it to be discarded when a better models with fewer "problems" is invented and shown to be a better fit AND have better explanatory power

explanatory power is not a quantifiable thing, but it's the ultimate goal of science. explanations connect the world of validity with the world of empirical fact. models are precise explanations, but explanations consist of a spectrum that includes stories. not just semi-scientific myths, like creation stories and how the leopard got its spots, but fiction that doesn't seem to have a utilitarian goal, yet comes to a satisfying conclusion.

the satisfaction of a good scientific result is the same (or similar) emotion as the satisfaction of a resolved plot, and possibly even a resolved harmony in music. these achieve the same emotional goal even though they don't have the form of a validity proof or an empirical demonstration

moreover, explanations are optional. Kepler thought it was important to explain why there are exactly 5 planets with the exact orbital radii they are observed to have (he thought it had to do with the 5 Platonic solids). today, because we have an explanation for how solar systems in general form by a chaotic process, we don't feel a need to explain why we have PRECISELY this configuration, though it would be interesting to know where we are in the probability distribution. if someone managed to prove exactly which rock hit which other rock to give us the solar system we have, it would be impressive, but it wouldn't be interesting.

similarly, anthropic principle

just as validity of love kind of real, empirical fact is another, I would argue that explanations are yet a third kind of real. different criteria apply to determining if an explanation is a good explanation than determining if a mathematical proof is valid or a phenomenon physically exists, but explanations are just as important because they connect and motivate the other two. a table of facts with no connection, no "significance," is not science, note is every mathematically valid combination of symbols math. good explanations make "sense" of them, recently by building mathematical models of physical realities

I also believe that causality is so hard to find in physics because it's not a feature of empirical facts, it's a feature of explanations. empirical data cannot prove that one event caused another, but model explanations can include casual relationships. when people prove that A caused B, they're actually demonstrating that M is a good, explanatory model for the data and in the mathematical description of M, A implies B.
