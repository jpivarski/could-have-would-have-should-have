# Could have, would have, should have

## If correlation does not imply causality, what does?

### Introduction

There's a famous dictum among scientists that observing a correlation in your data does not mean that one caused the other. For instance, a famous study found that the best predictor of a student's success is having books in the home—not reading them—having them. Before we start stocking our childrens' shelves with books, however, we have to ask, "Is this because some other factor predicts both student success and home libraries?"

That's the conundrum in general: A and B appear in together in the data a lot, but does A cause B, does B cause A, or does some other C cause both A and B? The famous dictum tells us to be skeptical, but it doesn't tell us how to determine if two things _are_ causally related.

Worse still, I'm a physicist. Physicists work in the basement of reality, studying the processes that underlie all the other sciences. Before we can even talk about student success, we have to define what it means for a student to succeed, who's a student, what's a human, how life is composed of chemicals, the forces that give rise to chemical reactions, what forces are, and how we ever came up with these crazy notions of time and space in the first place. From a physicist's perspective, the other sciences take a lot for granted.

The thing that has troubled me throughout my career is that I don't see anything in nature (meaning "particles and thier fundamental interactions") that _looks_ like causality. If we say, "Books cause good grades," we want to mean, "If we give students more books, they will get better grades." We want knowledge we can act on. More fundamentally, a statement about a cause in physics might be, "If I collide these two particles, they will form a Higgs boson." But statements like that aren't true: the particle transformations that underlie the whole physical world are probabilistic.

They're not just probabilistic, but they can involve atemporal influences. In the midst of a network of interactions that we draw as a Feynman diagram, it often happens that a particle will trace a closed loop in time, become an anti-particle when traveling backward in time, and annihilate with itself at an earlier time. These interactions are common enough that we have a name for them: penguins. (Richard Feynman once complained that the name "penguin" was absurd: these diagrams don't look anything like penguins. The speaker responded that they didn't look anything like Richard Feynman, either.)

These atemporal shenanigans have led many to say that quantum mechanics breaks causality. The way 19th century physicists thought nature worked, particles could only travel forward in time and each event happened because of the previous. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revealed that those commonsense assumptions were too strong.

However, I think we're using the wrong word. Quantum mechanics broke determinism, not causality. Consider a statement of causality like, "If I push this glass, it will fall and smash on the floor." In a classical (19th century) view of physics, everything from the pushed glass to the toppling over and smashing on the floor is deterministic: particles in the glass are attracted to the center of the Earth, they accelerate according to prescribed laws of motion, and even the smashing is a complex but deterministic process. It would be possible to describe the trajectory of each shard of glass and how it spins as it moves as a mathematical function. In fact, modern video games demonstrate this well: computers evaluate the formulae discovered by classical physicists, producing scenes that look just like real glasses falling off real tables.

The part classical physics leaves out is the "If I push this glass" clause. Some classical physicists were philosophical determinists: humans are made of atoms, which follow prescribed laws, so humans and their behaviors are prescribed as well. The human in this example couldn't _not_ push the glass. Other classical physicists thought there was a division in nature: human decision making is a divine spark, an input to nature's processes as much as a video game player is an exception to the simulation that governs everything else.

So even without quantum mechanics, there didn't seem to be any room for causality in nature. If we take one point of view, everything that happens is mathematically determined by past events, all the way back to the beginning or in an infinite chain without beginning (both are logically possible). The universe is a single equation, and equations are not causal: saying, "2 + _x_ = 7" does not cause _x_ to be 5. It just is 5. It hardly matters whether we run the formulas forward or backward—the whole is a single, self-consistent tapestry.

If we take the other point of view, however, then we are gods. Human decisions are as important as universal gravitation in determining what happens to the glass. In a video game, this is explicit: there is a subroutine that listens for keyboard or touchscreen input and inserts motion or forces into the simulation ad hoc. In reality, it begs the question of why humans are so special and where is that dividing line between the divine spark that thinks on its own and the particles that follow mathematical laws.

### Science fiction

Time travel stories are a laboratory for causality. We can only experiment on causality in fiction because time travel is impossible, as far as we know. Particles form closed time loops in penguin diagrams, but only in unobservable processes—science fiction takes the same scenarios and puts a human in the loop.

There are basically two kinds of time travel stories: what I like to call "destructive paradoxes" and "constructive paradoxes." The destructive kind is more common. Marty McFly travels to the past and accidentally prevents his parents from getting together, which ultimately means that he won't be born and thus could not have traveled into the past to have prevented his parents from getting together. It establishes a real paradox—a thing could not have happened because it happened.

These kinds of stories are usually a mess of contradictions. In _Back to the Future_, Marty McFly's siblings fade out of a photograph one by one and the danger is that Marty with disappear, too, with no explanation as to why his parents didn't get together without his influence. Or maybe the destruction would be localized, limited to merely our galaxy. These explanations don't make any sense, but I don't know how one would explain an event that prevented itself.

The other kind of story is rigorous about causality. The events that happen are the events that happen, even if the characters who participate know about them in advance. These stories have a long tradition, including stories about prophesies like _Oedipus Rex_. Oedipus was told that he would marry his mother (as Marty McFly almost did) and it was precisely the actions he took to try to prevent it that caused it to happen. The atemporal influence—a prophet, in this case—fits like a jigsaw piece into the tapestry of events. This is not much different from closed time loops in penguin diagrams: the particle, now anti-particle traveling backward to annihilate with itself, never misses.

This can be taken to a ridiculous extreme. Robert Heinlein's _All You Zombies_ is about a woman named Jane who is seduced by a man from the future, gets pregnant, and has medical complications while giving birth. In the confusion, the baby is stolen by another time-traveler and Jane is found to be a hermaphrodite. As a result of the damage, she is sexually reassigned as a man, joins a corps of time travelers, and eventually traveles back in time to seduce him/herself. The baby, likewise, is sent even further in the past because she (secretly he) is our main character. In fact, there is only one character in the whole story: the mother, father, and child are all the same person, as well as the supporting cast—the inventor of the time machine and the commander of the corps.

In perfectly consistent stories like this one, we have to wonder why they happen at all. Jane didn't share any genes with the human race; there is no physical reason why she would even look human. It is consistent that she invented time travel—she had to, after all—but it also would have been consistent if she hadn't ever existed.

Likewise, the process described by a quantum mechanical penguin diagram could entirely exist or entirely not exist. How well the diagram fits together (the degree to which waves overlap, allowing energy to flow between them) determines how probable the process is. That's what physicists are doing when they compute these diagrams: they multiply coupling strengths at each junction where particles could split up or combine, regardless of whether the influence comes from the future or the past, and if the product is a big number, the process is highly probable. This is an extremely precise science.

Nevertheless, it seems like much more of a problem when there are humans in the loop, such as Jane.
