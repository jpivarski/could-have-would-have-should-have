## If correlation does not imply causality, what does?

### 1. Causality

There's a famous dictum among scientists that observing a correlation in your data does not mean that one caused the other. For instance, a famous study found that the best predictor of a student's success is having books in the home—not reading them—having them. Before we start stocking our childrens' shelves with books, however, we have to ask, "Is this because some other factor predicts both student success and home libraries?"

That's the conundrum in general: A and B appear in together in the data a lot, but does A cause B, does B cause A, or does some other C cause both A and B? The famous dictum tells us to be skeptical, but it doesn't tell us how to determine if two things _are_ causally related.

Worse still, I'm a physicist. Physicists work in the basement of reality, studying the processes that underlie all the other sciences. Before we can even talk about student success, we have to define what it means for a student to succeed, who's a student, what's a human, how life is composed of chemicals, the forces that give rise to chemical reactions, what forces are, and how we ever came up with these crazy notions of time and space in the first place. From a physicist's perspective, the other sciences take a lot for granted.

The thing that has troubled me throughout my career is that I don't see anything in nature (meaning "particles and thier fundamental interactions") that _looks_ like causality. If we say, "Books cause good grades," we want to mean, "If we give students more books, they will get better grades." We want knowledge we can act on. More fundamentally, a statement about a cause in physics might be, "If I collide these two particles, they will form a Higgs boson." But statements like that aren't true: the particle transformations that underlie the whole physical world are probabilistic.

They're not just probabilistic, but they can involve atemporal influences. In the midst of a network of interactions that we draw as a Feynman diagram, it often happens that a particle will trace a closed loop in time, become an anti-particle when traveling backward in time, and annihilate with itself at an earlier time. These interactions are common enough that we have a name for them: penguins. (Richard Feynman once complained that the name "penguin" was absurd: these diagrams don't look anything like penguins. The speaker responded that they didn't look anything like Richard Feynman, either.)
