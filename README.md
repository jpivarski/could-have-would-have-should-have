# Could have, would have, should have

## If correlation does not imply causality, what does?

### Introduction

There's a famous dictum among scientists that observing a correlation in your data does not mean that one caused the other. For instance, a famous study found that the best predictor of a student's success is having books in the home—not reading them—having them. Before we start stocking our childrens' shelves with books, however, we have to ask, "Is this because some other factor predicts both student success and home libraries?"

That's the conundrum in general: A and B appear in together in the data a lot, but does A cause B, does B cause A, or does some other C cause both A and B? The famous dictum tells us to be skeptical, but it doesn't tell us how to determine if two things _are_ causally related.

Worse still, I'm a physicist. Physicists work in the basement of reality, studying the processes that underlie all the other sciences. Before we can even talk about student success, we have to define what it means for a student to succeed, who's a student, what's a human, how life is composed of chemicals, the forces that give rise to chemical reactions, what forces are, and how we ever came up with these crazy notions of time and space in the first place. From a physicist's perspective, the other sciences take a lot for granted.

The thing that has troubled me throughout my career is that I don't see anything in nature (meaning "particles and thier fundamental interactions") that _looks_ like causality. If we say, "Books cause good grades," we want to mean, "If we give students more books, they will get better grades." We want knowledge we can act on. More fundamentally, a statement about a cause in physics might be, "If I collide these two particles, they will form a Higgs boson." But statements like that aren't true: the particle transformations that underlie the whole physical world are probabilistic.

They're not just probabilistic, but they can involve atemporal influences. In the midst of a network of interactions that we draw as a Feynman diagram, it often happens that a particle will trace a closed loop in time, become an anti-particle when traveling backward in time, and annihilate with itself at an earlier time. These interactions are common enough that we have a name for them: penguins. (Richard Feynman once complained that the name "penguin" was absurd: these diagrams don't look anything like penguins. The speaker responded that they didn't look anything like Richard Feynman, either.)

These atemporal shenanigans have led many to say that quantum mechanics breaks causality. The way 19th century physicists thought nature worked, particles could only travel forward in time and each event happened because of the previous. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revealed that those commonsense assumptions were too strong.

However, I think we're using the wrong word. Quantum mechanics broke determinism, not causality. Consider a statement of causality like, "If I push this glass, it will fall and smash on the floor." In a classical (19th century) view of physics, everything from the pushed glass to the toppling over and smashing on the floor is deterministic: particles in the glass are attracted to the center of the Earth, they accelerate according to prescribed laws of motion, and even the smashing is a complex but deterministic process. It would be possible to describe the trajectory of each shard of glass and how it spins as it moves as a mathematical function. In fact, modern video games demonstrate this well: computers evaluate the formulae discovered by classical physicists, producing scenes that look just like real glasses falling off real tables.

The part classical physics leaves out is the "If I push this glass" clause. Some classical physicists were philosophical determinists: humans are made of atoms, which follow prescribed laws, so humans and their behaviors are prescribed as well. The human in this example couldn't _not_ push the glass. Other classical physicists thought there was a division in nature: human decision making is a divine spark, an input to nature's processes as much as a video game player is an exception to the simulation that governs everything else.

So even without quantum mechanics, there didn't seem to be any room for causality in nature. If we take one point of view, everything that happens is mathematically determined by past events, all the way back to the beginning or in an infinite chain without beginning (both are logically possible). The universe is a single equation, and equations are not causal: saying, "2 + _x_ = 7" does not cause _x_ to be 5. It just is 5. It hardly matters whether we run the formulas forward or backward—the whole is a single, self-consistent tapestry.

If we take the other point of view, however, then we are gods. Human decisions are as important as universal gravitation in determining what happens to the glass. In a video game, this is explicit: there is a subroutine that listens for keyboard or touchscreen input and inserts motion or forces into the simulation ad hoc. In reality, it begs the question of why humans are so special and where is that dividing line between the divine spark that thinks on its own and the particles that follow mathematical laws.

### Science fiction

Time travel stories are laboratories for causality. We can only experiment on causality in fiction because time travel is impossible in real life, as far as we know. Particles form closed time loops in penguin diagrams, but only in the parts that are fundamentally unobservable—if you reflect photons off of these particles to try to shed some light on the situation, the diagram becomes a different diagram, in which acausal influences become negligible or vanish. Science fiction takes the same scenarios and puts a human in the loop.

There are basically two kinds of time travel stories: what I like to call "destructive paradoxes" and "constructive paradoxes." The destructive kind is more common. Marty McFly travels to the past and accidentally prevents his parents from getting together, which ultimately means that he won't be born and thus could not have traveled into the past to have prevented his parents from getting together. It establishes a real paradox—a thing could not have happened because it happened.

These kinds of stories are usually a mess of contradictions. In _Back to the Future_, Marty McFly's siblings fade out of a photograph one by one and the danger is that Marty with disappear, too. There is no explanation why he would disappear after the event, rather than before, or why his parents still didn't get together without him there to have caused it. "Or maybe the destruction would be localized, limited to merely our galaxy." These explanations don't make any sense, but I don't know how one would explain an event that prevents itself.

The other kind of story, a constructive paradox, is rigorous about causality. The events that happen are the events that happen, even if the characters who participate know about them in advance. These stories have a long tradition, including stories about prophesies like _Oedipus Rex_. Oedipus was told that he would marry his mother (as Marty McFly almost did) and it was precisely the actions he took to try to prevent it that caused it to happen. The atemporal influence—a prophet, in this case—fits like a jigsaw piece into the tapestry of events. This is not much different from closed time loops in penguin diagrams: the particle, now an anti-particle traveling backward to annihilate with itself, never misses.

This can be taken to a ridiculous extreme. Robert Heinlein's _All You Zombies_ is about a woman named Jane who is seduced by a man from the future, gets pregnant, and has medical complications while giving birth. In the confusion, the baby is stolen by another time-traveler and Jane is found to be a hermaphrodite. As a result of the damage, she is sexually reassigned as a man, joins a corps of time travelers, and eventually traveles back in time to seduce him/herself. The baby, likewise, is sent even further in the past because she (secretly he) is our main character. In fact, there is only one character in the whole story: the mother, father, and child are all the same person, as well as the supporting cast—the inventor of the time machine and the commander of the corps.

In perfectly consistent stories like this one, we have to wonder why they happen at all. Jane didn't share any genes with the human race; there is no physical reason why she would even look human. It is consistent that she invented time travel—she had to, after all—but it would have been just as consistent if she had never existed.

Likewise, the process described by a quantum mechanical penguin diagram could entirely exist or entirely not exist. How well the diagram fits together (the degree to which wavefunctions overlap, allowing energy to flow between them like vibrations from a cello string to the cello's body) determines how probable the process is. That's what physicists are doing when they compute these diagrams: they multiply coupling strengths at each junction where particles could decay or combine, regardless of whether the influence comes from the future or the past, and if the product is a big number, the process is highly probable. This is an extremely precise science.

Nevertheless, it seems like much more of a problem when there are humans in the loop, such as Jane. Jane, who also seduced her mother, could have refused. But if she had, she would never have been born. Her existence is exactly as mysterious as the existence of the entire universe: why does anything exist, rather than nothing?

Science fiction does attempt to solve the problem, however, especially for destructive paradoxes. Changing something in the past is said to create an alternate timeline, a branch in history. If a normal timeline is a linear chain of causes, an alternate timeline is a fork in the line of dominoes. The junction event causes both of the parallel lines that follow. Usually, these histories are imagined to diverge socially and technologically from the splitting event. The alternate one always has zeppelins.

This view is made to seem less problematic than it is because the science fiction story usually follows the time travelers who "cause" the timeline to split. Following their subjective time through the story, history was not split "before" they intervened and it was split "after." If the alternate timeline is "wrong" (e.g. fascist), we follow the time travelers again as they go back and "prevent" themselves from splitting history in the first place. In the end, time had never split. All is good.

The problem is that we're only considering the time traveler's subjective history as real. We have value judgements about timelines: one is natural, the other is alternate. Which timeline exists is something evaluated from the traveler's point of view: it wasn't split, then it was, then it wasn't again. This kind of lazy storytelling uses time as a setting, somehow distinct from the stream of events in which the story plays itself out.

If we take the time-split seriously, what happens when the time traveler accidentally creates a fascist dystopia? The traveler is just _visiting_ a fascist dystopia. When the traveler goes back to the turning point and follows it forward on the original timeline, we all return home to our preferred timeline, but the fascist dystopia still exists. If it could be said to exist while we were visiting it, it still exists now. How, then, is it a victory when the original timeline is restored?

At their laziest, science fiction authors invoke Hugh Everett's many worlds hypothesis to explain the split timelines. Hugh Everett intended to explain the multi-valued nature of quantum properties (more on that later) by suggesting that every point in time is a split timeline. A particle that a quantum mechanic would say is "50% here, 50% there" is, in Everett's view, here in one universe and there in another; it's a low-level communication between diverging timelines that lets a particle appear to be in both places.

Although that's a possible explanation of quantum entanglement, it should be considered a disaster for storytelling. Not only is our timeline as real as the fascist dystopia, but so is every tiny variation in between. There's a universe in which an electron in my shoulder jiggles left and a universe in which it jiggles right, and a whole history propagates from each one after the entanglement washes out and the timelines diverge. History is thick with forks. Not only can we choose our favorite timeline, but we have a continuum to choose from.

If our hero escapes against 100-to-1 odds in one timeline, he didn't escape in the other 99. He didn't beat the odds. Storytelling becomes an exercise in selective reporting.

### The problem quantum mechanics poses

Physicists tend to romanticize the pre-quantum era as a time of innocence. In the good old days, nature was deterministic. Knowing the past and the laws of motion, we can derive the future. It all made sense.

The first upset was relativity: intuitively, time is an offstage drumbeat that continues at a relentless pace, regardless of what happens in the play, but Albert Einstein presented a vision of time as a dimension like space that can mix just as length and width mix when a picture frame rotates. Space-time rotates differently from space-space: space-space can rotate 180° to completely reverse the direction of a length, but space-time maxes out at 45°, a speed at which a unit of distance is covered in an equal unit of time, since time and space can now be measured in the same units. This 45° line is called the speed of light because light is one of the things that travels at this speed.

That was an upset, at first, because it introduces a no-man's land between past and future. Since the fastest trajectory any moving particle or propagating wave can take is limited, there are events happening now that we can't be aware of. A nearby star could be exploding, but it will take years for the light, gravitational waves, neutrinos, or anything else to reach us. More disturbingly, "now" is ambiguous. A star exploding today that we won't see for 10 years has, in another frame of reference, already exploded 9 years ago. In yet another frame of reference, it won't actually explode for another 9 years. These reference frames are the time that would be experienced by astronauts in fast spaceships, and their time is slower or faster such that all physical events that involve contact are unchanged.

These reference frames are as valid as our reference frame, stationary on Earth, and surprisingly enough, no real paradoxes arise from this situation. Our intuitive notion that "now" is independent of speed is wrong, but if we scale back our claims to what we can physically measure, contact interactions of two particles at the same point in space and time, then everything is consistent.

So in physicists' romanticized history, relativity is a part of classical mechanics. Then came quantum.

At small scales, particles don't appear to have single-valued properties. Particle position can have multiple values—here _and_ there—speeds can have multiple values, as can rotation rates and a suite of new properties that describe nuclear and subnuclear interactions. The one I find most striking is rotation rate, called "spin," which is always quantized in exact units. Imagine a record player that can only play at 33, 45, and 78 RPM, never anything in between. A quantum record player could play at 45 _and_ 78 RPM, but could never play at 60 RPM. That's just the way it works.
