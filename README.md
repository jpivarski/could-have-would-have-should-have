# Could have, would have, should have

Correlation does not imply causality. So what does?

causality in physics: "I knocked over the glass, which caused it to fall on the floor"

post-quantum physicists look back at classical mechanics as a time when causality could be taken seriously

but deterministic, classical physics doesn't admit any causality, either: would you say "7 + x = 9 causes x to be 2?"

the word "causality" pops up all over relativity, but relativity only puts limits on how far apart (in space and in time) causes and their effects can be from one another

quantum mechanics complicates causality (some would say "violates causality") because there are correlations between events farther apart than relativity allows

(this is where you should introduce Bell's inequality)

but this still doesn't get at causality as "making something happen that wouldn't have otherwise" or even "being responsible for something happening"

science fiction plays with the idea of causality a lot; after all, fiction/plot is a chain of "why?" questions and answers and science-inspired plots provide an opportunity to present philosophical questions directly

but most sci-fi is a mess of contradictions

typically destructive paradoxes: because a thing happened (Marty McFly stopped his parents from getting together), that thing can't happen (Marty McFly couldn't have been born to go back and stop his parents from getting together)

there are also constructive paradoxes (closed time loop), but they're more rare (Oedipus Rex, All You Zombies, The Arrival); though logically possible (all you need is a time machine)

generally, destructive paradoxes imagine a forked timeline: normal time is a linear chain of causes and effects, but a time machine lets the user fork the past into the "original timeline" and the "altered timeline." they either both exist (Mirror, Mirror) or only the most recently created or the timeline the main character is in exists

if they both exist, does the protagonist really do anything when they "restore the original timeline"? or are they just travelling back to a world they prefer?

Everett's many worlds hypothesis: maybe the multi-valued properties of quantum particles (e.g. a particle that's in two places at once) is really multiple deterministic worlds that communicate at small scales. sci-fi invokes this as an explanation of the forked timeline, but for its originally intended use as an explanation of quantum mechanics, EVERY minor variation in trajectory a microscopic particle could make spawns a new universe; the timeline is thick with forks

if every possible plot of a story is equally real—heros with 1000-to-1 odds actually lose 999 times—why should I care about the story in which they win? it's selective reporting

there's another extreme intended to save determinism in an apparently quantum world: superdeterminism. suppose that the universe is like a digital movie, consisting of pixel values at every grid point of the screen and time through the movie. there's no rule that forces a pixel value at one time to imply another pixel value at another time: everybody could glitch blue tomorrow. in this view, the long-distance, short-time quantum correlations that violate relativity's limits are accidental; Alice and Bob observe correlations no matter whether they measure X or Y because they can't choose to measure X or Y. They're part of the universal correlation that they're measuring

(remember that you've explained Bell's inequality by now)

I don't believe either of these extremes, but they do highlight what's important in a theory of causality: (1) there has to be a distinction between what does happen and what could happen, and (2) experimenters have to be free to choose what experiments to perform. free will is a prerequisite for identifying causes, and therefore a prerequisite for doing science

what is the real world? idealism vs realism was a central preoccupation of western philosophy

the world of logical/mathematical validity seems to be foundational because it can be perceived directly (a priori) and without error (in principle); the discovery and redicovery of pi to hundreds of digits in classical Greece and classical China is a good demonstration that there's something real there, something both cultures had access to without being able to communicate with one another

the world of empirical fact seems to be foundational because the minds that think up mathematical ideas are clearly machines; they can be dissected and observed in vivo with fMRI

the methods for deciding whether a mathematical statement is valid and whether an empirical fact is true have few similarities. they both require consistency (the truth is not inconsistent), but mathematical statements must be proven via a machine of grammar while empirical facts must be proven by reproducibility and lateral observations. the whole tool-set is different for these two things: why do we use the same word, "real" to describe them both?

Plato, etc. argued that math is real at the expense of the physical world; Democritus etc. argued that the physical world is real at the expense of human perceptions; both sides have had ancient and modern adherents

but why not say they're two KINDS of reality? "real" is a human word, and we use human words to label collections similar things that we encounter, and these two things (math and physics) are rather different, so let's use two words. I like "valid" and "factual"; what's real about a logical statement is its implication, what's real about an empirical fact is its persistent ability to generate sense phenomena

furthermore, the way we think about science tends to treat these as two distinct concepts that must be explicitly connected. in many fields of science, practiciners talk about "models." a model is a mathematical structure that represents an aspect of the physical world, but shouldn't be confused with it. maybe it's a rough model of stock prices, arbitrarily tuned to agree with the data, or maybe it's the very precise Standard Model of particle physics, intended to answer questions of "what's really going on?" but still physicists don't BELIEVE in it. they expect it to be discarded when a better model with fewer "problems" is invented, shown to be a better fit, AND have better explanatory power

explanatory power is not a quantifiable thing, but it's the ultimate goal of science. scientists don't actually follow the falsification criterion: a single contrary measurement doesn't overturn an otherwise successful theory. if a theory makes sense in a way that alternatives don't, they'll give it the benefit of the doubt and keep looking for mistakes/complications that led to the wayward measurement. in the end, what matters is the story the model tells

models connect the world of validity with the world of empirical fact. they are precise explanations, but explanations consist of a spectrum that includes all stories. not just semi-scientific myths, like creation stories and How the Leopard Got its Spots, but fiction that doesn't seem to have a utilitarian goal, yet comes to a satisfying conclusion. taken as a lesson in life, Star Wars is a bit dumb; it's not judged on its realism, it's judged on whether it is "true to life" (particularly the recent ones, which have divided fans on whether they "feel right")

the satisfaction of a good scientific result is the same (or similar) emotion as the satisfaction of a well-resolved plot, and possibly even a resolved harmony in music. these achieve the same emotional goal even though the latter two aren't intended to produce True and Reliable Knowledge

moreover, explanations are optional. our need for them comes and goes. Kepler thought it was important to explain why there are exactly 5 planets with the exact orbital radii they are observed to have (he thought it had to do with the 5 Platonic solids). today, because we have an explanation for how solar systems in general form by a chaotic process, we don't feel a need to explain why we have PRECISELY this configuration, though it would be interesting to know where we are in the probability distribution. if someone managed to prove exactly which rock hit which other rock to give us the solar system we have, it would be impressive, but it wouldn't be interesting.

similarly, anthropic principle

just as validity is a kind of real, empirical fact is another, I would argue that explanations are yet a third kind of real. different criteria apply to determining if an explanation is a good explanation than determining if a mathematical proof is valid or a phenomenon physically exists, but explanations are just as important because they connect and motivate the other two. a table of facts with no connection, no "significance," is not science, note is every mathematically valid combination of symbols math. good explanations make "sense" of them, recently by building mathematical models of physical realities.

what this third pillar lacks is a formal method: logicians have symbol-pushing proofs and scientists have the scientific method, but we don't have a way of saying what makes a good explanation except our guts. we know it when we see it. in the middle ages, science was in a similar position, and before classical Greece, mathematics was, too: they were both practiced (medieval scientists did advance knowledge; Babylonians and Egyptians did advance math), but they didn't have formal methods yet. the study of "What makes a good explanation?" from precise models of physics to Star Wars plot holes, is practiced, but not formally developed.

what does this have to do with causality? the reason it's so hard to find causality as a property of physics is because it's not an empirical fact; it's a feature of explanations. empirical data alone can't prove that one event caused another, but mathematical models can include casual relationships, and models can be shown to be good explanations of the data. when scientists DO prove that A caused B, they're actually demonstrating that M, a model in which A implies B, is a good explanation of the data

Judea Pearl's casual revolution, do calculus

this definition of causality is explicitly a feature of the model: if two models, one with an arrow from A to B and the other without, are both equally good statistical fits to the data, then we couldn't say that "the data prove that A causes B." if we have a non-statistical reason for believing the first model (it "rings true" and the other doesn't), then we might be inclined to say that A causes B, but wouldn't be able to defend it. finally, even if our best model with all the data in favor of it claims that A causes B, a new, better model might be invented tomorrow in which A does not cause B. causality is model-dependent

the definition also relies on counterfactuals: the model makes claims about what WOULD HAVE happened if an experimenter had intervened. the empirical data (neglecting mismeasurement) say what IS, but we need other parts of speech to describe events that COULD HAVE happened but didn't. this is another way in which causality is beyond the realm of physics and why totally deterministic visions of the world aren't really causal: the Big Bang and the apple falling on Newton's head are part of the same equation; you can play, fast-forward, or rewind, but you can't keep all particle trajectories at one time and not have the apple fall on his head without violating the laws that keep them on their rails

so we're back to imagining many worlds, but with a difference: one of them is distinguished, and we might as well call that special world the "real" world. one set of events IS, the others COULD BE. this is not Hugh Everett's many worlds, in which each quantum possibility is equally valid; it's also not sci-fi's splitting timelines because the COULD BEs never existed and never will—the idea of "changing" a COULD HAVE BEEN into an ACTUALLY WAS is just as fraught with paradoxes as ever.

what COULD BEs denote are states allowed by the model but not observed in data. the WOULD BEs are states that the model predicts that depend on intervention (a do operator). but physics (and science in general) focuses on what IS

what about long distance correlations in quantum mechanics, like Bell's inequality? those aren't causes: there isn't an intervention tht forces Alice's box to read "spin up," so we can't ask the question of what would happen to Bob's box if Alice applies "do(spin up)." Alice can open the box or not, but opening the box doesn't imply a specific value for Bob or even a change in distribution. in Pearl's arrow diagrams, Alice and Bob's observations are a single event, drawn as a single node, despite being far apart in space (or connected by an undirected line).

this comes to the second point, that the experimenter's choice is a necessary part of defining causality. most 19th century physicists didn't believe that everything is deterministic—they believed that everything is deterministic except for human agents. this is the intuitive causality of "I knocked over the glass, which caused it to fall on the floor"; the choice to knock over the glass (or an earlier choice that led to the accident) was free, derived from my human agency, but once it left my hand, the lock-step laws of physics directed it to the floor.

this is unpalatable because there's a cut: human agency not subject to rigid laws, and inanimate particles that go where the math leads them. it opens questions like, "do animals have agency?" and "which ones?" or even "what about a single-celled human zygote?" (more on SHOULD BE below). we find ourselves dividing the world into beings and non-beings

an extremist view, held by Calvinists and scientific materialists alike, is that everything is rigidly determined, including humans. as we've seen above, this removes our ability to make inferences from experiments: namely, to do science. it's ironic that in common parlance, this is considered the "scientific" view.

to show the irony of that view, consider a neuroscientist who uses an fMRI machine to show that a human subject's decisions are 100% correlated with an injected hormone, one could infer that the human subject is a deterministic product of physical law. but if the same applies to the neuroscientist, then that undermines the original conclusion: the experimenter could not perform the "do" operator because he was part of a combined correlation, and we could not infer that the hormone "caused" the subject's behavior.

to add ironies to ironies, quantum mechanics might provide an out. it is an empirical fact that the properties of microscopic particles at a given time are not 100% correlated with their properties at previous times. they randomly jump. alternatively, we could say that they make decisions, though that might be a bad choice of words because they don't seem to have the "intention" that we associate with decisions. but if nature has flexibility at the fundamental level, the idea that human agents can turn some COULD BEs into ISes doesn't necessarily violate physical laws. they're roads, not rails.

another reason we need to believe that we have free will, the power to convert COULD BE worlds into an IS world, is that we presume that some actions SHOULD BE. one can't even talk about the moral value of a choice if there are no choices. SHOULD BE (some choices are better than others) depends on WOULD BE (agents can make choices), which depends on COULD BE (possible worlds are intelligible, though distinct from the real world).

at this point, you might be wondering if I'm going to get moralistic, prescribing a particular set of good/bad values for each choice, but I'm more interested in the mere existence of such a set. when we choose some actions over others, we might not even recognize those choices as ethical ones—even the answer to "what am I going to do today?" is a valuation of some choices over others. they don't have to be prescriptive or universally binding for the property that sets SHOULD BE apart from WOULD BE.
