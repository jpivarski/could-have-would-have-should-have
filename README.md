# Could have, would have, should have

## If correlation does not imply causality, what does?

### Introduction

There's a famous dictum among scientists that observing a correlation in your data does not mean that one caused the other. For instance, a famous study found that the best predictor of a student's success is having books in the home—not reading them—having them. Before we start stocking our childrens' shelves with books, however, we have to ask, "Is this because some other factor predicts both student success and home libraries?"

That's the conundrum in general: A and B appear in together in the data a lot, but does A cause B, does B cause A, or does some other C cause both A and B? The famous dictum tells us to be skeptical, but it doesn't tell us how to determine if two things _are_ causally related.

Worse still, I'm a physicist. Physicists work in the basement of reality, studying the processes that underlie all the other sciences. Before we can even talk about student success, we have to define what it means for a student to succeed, who's a student, what's a human, how life is composed of chemicals, the forces that give rise to chemical reactions, what forces are, and how we ever came up with these crazy notions of time and space in the first place. From a physicist's perspective, the other sciences take a lot for granted.

The thing that has troubled me throughout my career is that I don't see anything in nature (meaning "particles and thier fundamental interactions") that _looks_ like causality. If we say, "Books cause good grades," we want to mean, "If we give students more books, they will get better grades." We want knowledge we can act on. More fundamentally, a statement about a cause in physics might be, "If I collide these two particles, they will form a Higgs boson." But statements like that aren't true: the particle transformations that underlie the whole physical world are probabilistic.

They're not just probabilistic, but they can involve atemporal influences. In the midst of a network of interactions that we draw as a Feynman diagram, it often happens that a particle will trace a closed loop in time, become an anti-particle when traveling backward in time, and annihilate with itself at an earlier time. These interactions are common enough that we have a name for them: penguins. (Richard Feynman once complained that the name "penguin" was absurd: these diagrams don't look anything like penguins. The speaker responded that they didn't look anything like Richard Feynman, either.)

These atemporal shenanigans have led many to say that quantum mechanics breaks causality. The way 19th century physicists thought nature worked, particles could only travel forward in time and each event happened because of the previous. The discovery of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revealed that those commonsense assumptions were too strong.

However, I think we're using the wrong word. Quantum mechanics broke determinism, not causality. Consider a statement of causality like, "If I push this glass, it will fall and smash on the floor." In a classical (19th century) view of physics, everything from the pushed glass to the toppling over and smashing on the floor is deterministic: particles in the glass are attracted to the center of the Earth, they accelerate according to prescribed laws of motion, and even the smashing is a complex but deterministic process. It would be possible to describe the trajectory of each shard of glass and how it spins as it moves as a mathematical function. In fact, modern video games demonstrate this well: computers evaluate the formulae discovered by classical physicists, producing scenes that look just like real glasses falling off real tables.

The part classical physics leaves out is the "If I push this glass" clause. Some classical physicists were philosophical determinists: humans are made of atoms, which follow prescribed laws, so humans and their behaviors are prescribed as well. The human in this example couldn't _not_ push the glass. Other classical physicists thought there was a division in nature: human decision making is a divine spark, an input to nature's processes as much as a video game player is an exception to the simulation that governs everything else.

So even without quantum mechanics, there didn't seem to be any room for causality in nature. If we take one point of view, everything that happens is mathematically determined by past events, all the way back to the beginning or in an infinite chain without beginning (both are logically possible). The universe is a single equation, and equations are not causal: saying, "2 + _x_ = 7" does not cause _x_ to be 5. It just is 5. It hardly matters whether we run the formulas forward or backward—the whole is a single, self-consistent tapestry.

If we take the other point of view, however, then we are gods. Human decisions are as important as universal gravitation in determining what happens to the glass. In a video game, this is explicit: there is a subroutine that listens for keyboard or touchscreen input and inserts motion or forces into the simulation ad hoc. In reality, it begs the question of why humans are so special and where is that dividing line between the divine spark that thinks on its own and the particles that follow mathematical laws.
